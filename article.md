# Functional Reactive Programming

Short ingress with some highlights and summaries of what FRP is and what we will
cover in the article

## Background / History

Short background of FRP, maybe with some history. Mention the birth of FRP with
FRAN and academic beginnings.

## Theoretical foundation

Write about the theoretical foundation for FRP. This will most likely be the
biggest or second biggest part of the article

### Reactive Programming

Write about reactive programming. Keep it short and sweet, too much to cover in
depth I think.

### Functional Programming

Write about functional programming. Also a short and sweet section, will most
likely have been covered earlier or later in the magazine.

### Functional Reactive Programming

Write about how the two paradigms come together to form FRP. What the synergy of
FP and RP means on a theoretical level.

## FRP in practice

Maybe a section with a more practical look at FRP. Which problems does it solve
and why does it offer a worthwhile solution? This is probably the place to
mention animation, interfaces and asynchronous/evented programming.

Maybe also mention Reactive Extensions and similar libs here.

## FRP example

A short example using Bacon.js.

### Bacon.js introduction

Write a short introduction to Bacon.js and its API, mention EventStreams and
Properties.

### Bacon.js example

The example itself. Implement an interface or some collaborative thing

## Summary / Wrapup

Write a short summary here.
