# Functional Reactive Programming

In this article we explore the history of functional reactive programming, and
see that it is not necessarily as new at it can seem. Functional reactive
programming is a merge of two different programming paradigms; functional
and reactive. We will see what each of those is and how to use them in
combination.

After reading this article, you will have a working knowledge of what
functional reactive programming is, and how to use it in javascrupt using
a library called Bacon.js. We will see a practical example and some real
life code.

## Background and History

Functional Reactive Programming is not a new concept in computer science. It can
be traced to 1997, when Conal Elliot, from the Microsoft Research Group,
and Paul Hudak, from Yale University released, the research paper
"Functional Reactive Animation" in the proceedings of International Conference
on Functional Programming [1].

The academic paper introduces a collection of data types and functions in a
system called FRAN (**F**unctional **R**eactive **AN**imations). FRAN in
turn is preceeded by work done by Conal Elliot and the ActiveVRML modeling
language. ActiveVRML was a declerative modeling language for defining simple, sophisticated and interactive animations [2].

The implementation of FRAN was based on the programming language Haskell, which
is an easy extendable functional programming language. As Haskell may have some
problems with space leaks, FRAN did aswell. To try to fix this, Paul Hudak
(et. al.) introduced Real Time FRP (RT-FRP) in a paper from 2001 [3]. RT-FRP
made some simplifications to the model, but in turn lost some of the
expressiveness of the FRAN system. A short year after introducing RT-FRP,
the Yale team also released Event-Driven FRP, focusing on value changes
triggered by events and propagating values only on these events [4].

Some years later, Conal Elliot published the paper "Push-Pull Functional
Reactive Programming" (2009) [5]. In this paper he described a way to implement
FRP with a more modernized interface, and where the reactive values had a more
simplified semantic. All reactive values were described with push- and pull-based
evaluation.

In later years, several different implementations and libraries have arisen.
Some examples are the compile-to-javascript languages
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and [Flapjax](http://www.flapjax-lang.org/),
or [Bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) â€“ which is written
completely in Javascript. There are also implementations in languages like
C#, Java, Scala, Objective-C, Ruby, and more.

## Theoretical foundation

Functional reactive programming is the combination of two other programming
paradigms; functional and reactive programming. The original goal of FRP is to
unite the statefulness and mutative nature of user interfaces with the
semantic determinism and rigorous reasoning of pure functional programming.

At its most basic level, FRP is about abstractions for representing a value as
it changes, or mutates, over time. Historically, this has been difficult to
achieve using traditional imperative programming. The imperative programming
paradigm is temporally discrete in nature, which has only allowed for indirect
representation of discretely evolving values.

We will now look at which parts from the two paradigms FRP makes use of and
how it makes FRP possible.

### Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that deals primarily with the
flow of data and semantics for expressing how changes in state propagates
through a dependency graph. Using reactive programming, a programmer can
easily express data flows and set up dependencies and leave the propagation of
change to the execution model of the language or liberary used.

The best example of data flow is the interaction between cells in a
spreadsheet. If you change one cell, another cell which has a depencendy on
that cell would automatically be updated. For instance with one cell being the
sum of two other cells.

This concept of data flow bears a resemblence to the well known observer
pattern. Using the reactive semantics allows us to express the same as the
observer pattern, but easier and with more granularity. Where the observer
pattern deals with whole objects, reactive data flows would be applicable to
attributes of objects.

### Functional Programming

Achieving rigorous and formal reasoning in combination with user interfaces
was the original goal of FRP. This trait is enabled by what is known as pure
functions. Pure functions are functions that depend only on their inputs and
not the state of the program being run.

Pure functions also does not mutate anything outside of itself. This helps
eliminating side effects which is one of the main reasons pure functions
enable formal reasoning and semantic determinism.

Functions make up the core building block of functional programming, but they
would not be very useful if they could not be composed and combined.
Composition of functions depend on another trait of functional programming,
which is immutability. Immutability means that once a value is instansiated it
does not change. This means that we can take functions or data and combine
them in many different ways without affecting the original representation of
the function or data.

To compose functions we use another class of functions known as higher order
functions. These take functions as inputs and produce functions as output.
This class of functions are also known as combinators. The most well-known
combinators are map, reduce and filter.

When composing functions in this manner, we program declaratively. A
declarative programming style is more concerned with the _what_ happens
instead of the _how_ something happens.

The reason immutability and purely functional functions are hard to reconcile
with real world programming is that most important values are mutable to
change. This becomes especially apparent in user interfaces where every user
action mutates a piece of the program state.

### Functional Reactive Programming

When we combine the notion of data flow from reative programming and the pure,
side-effect free, functions and combinators from functional programming, we get
(classical) functional reactive programming.

Because the semantics of reactive programming allows us to define datatypes
that represent a value that handles its own mutation we can use that to
introduce "safe" abstractions. Functions opreate only on theese abstracted
datatypes and from the view of the function the state is immutable. All the
mutation is left to the underlying implementation of the datatype.

The way dependencies are set up in dataflow graphs is very compatible with the
notion of immutability from functional programming. Data flows in only one
direction, much like the way data is passed from function to funciton without
ever mutating the original representation. This allows us to use the same
method of composition in functional reactive programming as in functional
programming.

In functional reactive programming, we treat mutable values as time-varying,
which is better suited to represent the temporal aspect of change. FRP has two
different ways of representing a value that changes with time; continous and
discrete.

A continous value, or behavior as it is commonly known in FRP, is the
representation of something that always has a value when observed. For
instance the current time or the height of a person. It does never not have a
value. This can be expressed as a function of time `t` which yields a value
`v`. Discrete values, on the other hand, is a sequence of values with an
associated timestamp. These values are commonly refered to as events.

## In Practice

Maybe a section with a more practical look at FRP. Which problems does it solve
and why does it offer a worthwhile solution? This is probably the place to
mention animation, interfaces and asynchronous/evented programming.

Maybe also mention Reactive Extensions and similar libs here.

## Practical Example

One way to use functional reactive programming in Javascript is with
the library Bacon.js. Bacon.js is created by Finish developer
Juha Paananen from Reaktor. In this section we will see how Bacon.js
can be used to achieve FRP in the browser.

We will use Bacon.js to implement a simple SVG dot-drawer:
tracking the mouse movement and when the mouse button is pressed draw
dots every `N` milliseconds.

### Bacon.js Introduction

As with theoretical FRP, we have events and behaviours in Bacon.js, but
instead of calling it a behaviour we call it a Property. A property always
has a value, but an event stream is discrete.

In Bacon.js we can wrap event sources to reactive data types using different
functions. E.g. `Bacon.fromEventTarget()` wraps events from DOM or jQuery events,
objects from Node.JS' EventEmitter, or `Bacon.fromPromise()` creates
reactive data from promises. There are also several other methods, like creating
data types from callbacks, from arrays, constant intervals and polling.

In the most simplest form we can react to an event like so:

```javascript
Bacon.fromEventTarget($("button"), "click")
  .onValue(function() { console.log("FRP!"); })
```

We see that we can print string when a button is clicked. In most cases,
Bacon.JS returns a new event stream or property, but `.onValue` returns
a function to unsubscribe to the events. Bacon.js uses lazy evaluation
internally, only pushing values if there is subscribers. For example,
without adding `.onValue` (or other methods adding subscribers,
like `assign`) no value will get pushed.

```javascript
Bacon.fromEventTarget($("button"), "click")
  .doAction(function() { console.log("FRP!"); })
```

Prints nothing, even if the button is clicked.

But Bacon.js can do much, much more than just printing values on clicks.
We can start getting creative by using regular functional operations like
`map`, `filter`, `reduce` and more. We will see more of this in the next
section, where we implement our example.

### Bacon.js Example Implementation

The kind of state management and input/output handling this example demands
could easily become a very cumbersome task using traditional imperative
code. Using FRP, how ever, this should be a breeze.

We begin by initiating some event streams we shall use to compose
a property of mouse movements.

```javascript
var $svg = $('svg'),
    mouseMove = bacon.fromEventTarget($svg, 'mousemove'),
    mouseDown = bacon.fromEventTarget($svg, 'mousedown').map(true),
    mouseUp = bacon.fromEventTarget($svg, 'mouseup').map(false);
```

In this code we start of by fetching our SVG element. With that element,
we create three different event streams: `mouseMove` - a property
(behaviour in traditional FRP lingo), that holds information about
the position of the mouse. `mouseDown` - a discrete reactive
data type that is triggered each time a mouse is clicked. Note the
transformation on the end. By default, using `.fromEventTarget`
gives the jQuery event as value, but by doing `.map(true)` we know we
have a event stream with the value `true` each time the event stream is
triggered. The `mouseUp` value is similar to `mouseDown`,
except we transform the data value to be false for each trigger.

Using both the `mouseDown` and `mouseUp` we can compose a new behaviour
indicating whether or not the mouse button is held down.

```javascript
var isClickDown = mouseDown.merge(mouseUp).toProperty(false);
```

We see, if we have a stream of `false` values and merge it with a
stream of `true` values, the resulting stream will be a stream of
both `false` and `true`. We use `.toProperty(false)` to generate
a property with `false` as the initial default value. The result,
as stored in `isClickDown`, is a property that has the value `true`
if the mouse is clicked, and `false` otherwise. It's important to
notice, `mouseDown` and `mouseUp` is not altered in any way, and
the returned `isClickDown` is an new immutable property.

We can use these reactive data types to compose the information we
need. We will now define `mouseNewXY`; a property with values of
the mouses x and y position when the mouse is clicked.

```javascript
var mouseNewXY =
  mouseMove
    .filter(isClickDown)
    .throttle(50)
    .map(function (e) {
      return {
        x: e.clientX,
        y: e.clientY,
        color: randomColor
      };
    });
```

We see we take base in `mouseMove` which we have defined earlier.
Taking that event stream, we use filter and the property `isClickedDown`
to generate a property that has value only when the property `isClickDown`
is `true` â€“ that is, only when the mouse button is pressed.

With that generated property, we throttle it per 50 milliseconds. The
result is converted to an discrete event stream that has a value only
every 50 milliseconds.

Remember, per default `.fromEventTarget` gives the jQuery event-object
as value, so we need to transform the value to a more readable format.
In this example randomColor is just a random generated hex color.

We now have a event stream of a object with the mouse position and a color,
only when the mouse button is pressed, and throttled over 50 ms. We can
use this event stream to draw out circles.

```javascript
mouseNewXY
  .map(toCircle)
  .assign($svg[0], 'appendChild');
```

In this code we have `toCircle`, a simple helper function used to
convert from the data object to a SVG circle DOM element. We use
Bacon's `assign` to terminate the reactive data type. Each circle element
we get we append it to the SVG DOM element. Now we have a working
example, in just 20 lines of code (plus helpers).

By using this example, we see some pretty interesting aspects.
We see how easily we can compose reactive data types and manipulate
them using functional programming. We have no unwanted side-effects
or manual handling of states.

The very cool thing is, we can easily extend this example and add
multiple input sources or even outputs. As all reactive data types
are immutable, we can use them again in different ways. For example,
if we want to show if the mouse is pressed we can use the following
code:

```javascript
isClickDown
  .map(function (down) {
    return down ? 'Yes' : 'No';
  })
  .assign($('.mouse-down'), 'text')
```

We can use `isClickDown` again, without having to think about it's
previous involvements. Similarly, if we want to make this distributed
through web sockets by adding a new input source. Replacing the code
from before:

```javascript
mouseNewXY
  .merge(bacon.fromEventTarget(socket, 'data'))
  .map(toCircle)
  .assign($svg[0], 'appendChild');
```

In this example we say that the socket is a socket instance of
socket.io, and that it emits our mouse data on the channgel `data`.

In addition we would have to emit data using our `mouseNewXY` data type.
